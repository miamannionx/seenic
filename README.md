Hack Cambridge 2022 Hackathon Entry: SEENIC


## Overview

Following the global pandemic many people have started to appreciate spending more time in nature, but have often struggled to explore all the paths and green spaces that their local area has to offer. 

Seenic is a mobile application that is designed to give people recommendations on walking routes in their local area which are tailored to their personal preferences, as well as provide a platform to stay connected with their local community. 

## App Functionality

Go on a walk:
- User selects desired distance and features of their walk.
- For example 5km, coffee shop, park, supermarket.
- User has option of inviting friend on walk.
- App generates potential walking routes, displayed on interactive map.

See other walk routes and pictures:
- User can view most popular walks in their local area.
- This will include pictures, reviews and ratings of walks.
- Users can upload their own walks and "like" and "comment" on other people's.

Connect with the community:
- User has feed of events happening in local green spaces.
- This can include park runs, community garden events, neighbourhood cleanups, etc.

Seeing your friends walks:
- Users can add friends and see the walks they've uploaded on their "Your friends" feed.
- Users can view the friend's routes, pictures and reviews, and can like and comment on them.
- Friends can be synced from contacts or added by username.

Multi-platform syncing:
- In future we intend to implement a feature which allows the users to sync their fitbit / smartwatch to the app so if a walk is autodetected, the app gives the user the option to upload and comment on the route.
