Hack Cambridge 2022 Hackathon Entry: SEENIC


- Overview

Following the global pandemic many people have started to appreciate spending more time in nature, but have often struggled to explore all the paths and green spaces that their local area has to offer. 

Seenic is a mobile application that is designed to give people recommendations on walking routes in their local area which are tailored to their personal preferences, as well as provide a platform to stay connected with their local community. 

- App Functionality

Go on a walk:
  The user is able to select an approximate amount of time for the walk and specify whether they want certain features to be included for example coffee shops, parks or a supermarket. 
Based on the user’s choices the app would suggest potential walking routes based on their location and preferences, displaying them on an interactive map. 

See other walk routes and pictures:
  When the route is clicked on the user would be able to see photos and comments that other people have uploaded for that route. The user is also able to choose to notify certain friends to join them on their walk which could then accepted and added to their calendar. 
There is also the option to view the most popular walking routes in your local area based on other user’s uploading and rating their walks. 

Sharing and uploading your own walks.
  The user could then see routes and images that their friends have recently uploaded on the ‘Your friends’ page. The third option allows the user to view upcoming outdoor events such as group runs in the local area and add them to their calendar.

Multi-platform syncing:
  In future we intend to implement a feature which allows the users to sync their fitbit / smartwatch to the app so if a walk is autodetected, the app gives the user the option to upload and comment on the route.
